This folder contains the solutions to the first assignment (as well as auxiliary
files needed to run the solution scripts) of the
first course of the Data Science at Scale specialization on Coursera.

For the instruction please refer to the course Assignment instructions>

Please note that the scripts must be run in python 2.7 (python 3 requires update of the printing statements)
as the course grader uses this version of Python.
